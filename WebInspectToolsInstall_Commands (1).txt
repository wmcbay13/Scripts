PYTHON 3.7.7 INSTALL (python-3.7.7-amd64.exe):

	1. Uninstall existing Python 2.7.16
	2. Install Python 3.7.7 (Do NOT use 3.8 - SSLyze won't work with it)
	3. Python install wizard has two checkboxes that should be checked:
		* Install launcher for All Users
		* Add Python 3.7 to PATH
	4. On completion, the following entries should be added to PATH:
		*  C:\Program Files\Python37\
		*  C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts\


SSLyze INSTALL (Install after Python is updated, as this uses PIP to install and needs Python 3.7.x.  SSLyze will NOT work with the latest Python 3.8):

	1. Command line - Install nassl:
		* pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org nassl

	2. Update pip: 
		* python -m pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --upgrade pip
	3. Install SSLyze:
		* pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org  sslyze


SQLMAP 'INSTALL' (file replacement instead of actual install):
	To 'install' SQLmap, there is not a formal installer, as it is a python script, but has a lot of folders/files.
	To update, just delete the folders/files from the path below:

		C:\Manual & QA Test Tools\sqlmap\

	Then, unzip the SQLmap file and replace all the deleted folders/files with those inside the zipped folder: 'sqlmapproject-sqlmap-d0be782'
	This will keep the .py and other files in the same place and the shortcut should still work fine, launching the command line as Admin.

	WARNING: Apparently our AV software sees SQLmap as malware, so this might be a consideration, though should still copy to the system.  Chrome did reject it when I dowloaded the .zip, but IE was able to grab it fine.
